        Implements the custom authentication method.

        Since a particular user may have multiple email accounts associated
        with their account and they should be able to log in using any one of
        them, this authentication backend first matches the given email to the
        :class:`django_email_accounts.models.User` instance to which the email
        is associated and then authenticates the credentials against that user
        instance.

        The signature of the method is adapted to take a username argument
        representing the email of the user. This way, it matches the default
        Django authentication backend method signature which allows admin users
        to log in to the admin console using any of their associated emails.

        :returns: :class:`django_email_accounts.models.User` instance if the
            authentication is successful, or ``None`` otherwise.
