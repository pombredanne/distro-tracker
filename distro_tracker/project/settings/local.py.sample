"""Site-specific settings

Rename this file to local.py and edit it to customize the settings of your
Distro Tracker installation. By default it imports settings from the ``selected.py``
file which is a symlink to the type of installation to you have
(typically, ``production.py`` or ``development.py``) and lets you add
overrides on top of those type-of-installation-specific settings.
