    A class decorator to mark that a
    :py:class:`Command <distro_tracker.mail.control.commands.base.Command>`
    subclass requires confirmation before it is executed.

    Classes decorated by this decorator can provide two additional methods:

    - ``pre_confirm`` - for actions which should come before asking for
       confirmation for the command. If this method does not return an
       object which evalutes as a True Boolean, no confirmation is sent.
       It should also make sure to add appropriate status messages to the
       response.
       If the method is not provided, then a default response indicating that
       a confirmation is required is output.

    - ``get_confirmation_message`` - Method which should return a string
       containing an additional message to be included in the confirmation
       email.
