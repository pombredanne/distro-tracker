"""An app which enables Distro Tracker to access vendor-specific functionality.

Vendors can define their own specific set of rules for mail dispatch and the
Web interface or provide additional data which Distro Tracker can plug in to
appropriate functions.

Each rule should be implemented as a callable which takes a defined set of
arguments with a predefined name. The supported callables are listed in the
:py:mod:`distro_tracker.vendor.skeleton.rules` module of the
:py:mod:`distro_tracker.vendor.skeleton` package which can serve as a starting
point for the implementation of the vendor-specific functions.

.. note::
   You should copy this package to a new directory and give it a descriptive
   name.

.. note::
   Make sure the package is a valid Django app.
