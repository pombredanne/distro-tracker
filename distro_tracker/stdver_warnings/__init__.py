This app implements displaying warnings if a package has an outdated
Standards-Version field, when compared to the current version of the
``debian-policy`` package in the default repository.

The warning is displayed as an entry to the
:class:`distro_tracker.core.panels.ActionNeededPanel`>

This functionality is extracted to a separate app to allow other vendors to
optionally activate it.
