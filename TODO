Bugs and new features:
----------------------
See http://bugs.debian.org/tracker.debian.org for almost everything.

Refactoring:
------------
* Create a generic task downloading data from an URL and transforming it
  into action items.
* Handle octicons through a template tag which ensures we have proper
  fallback for screen readers and text-mode (non CSS-aware) browsers.
  cf #753800
* Template tag for bootstrap pagination widget.

Misc possible enhancements:
---------------------------
* Add a subscriber count on each package page (and put
  subscription-related actions in the same panel).
* Paul Wise's input: https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2014/07/msg00092.html
* Codebase is Python 3 compatible but some optional dependencies need to
  be ported:
  - python-soappy => switch to pysimplesoap
  - python-ldap => replace LDAP access with nm.d.o REST api, cf #797223
* Re-enable a smarter clickjacking protection: only activate it when the
  page is rendered for a logged in user and allow callers to pass a
  "anonymous=1" parameter that will force render the web page as if
  the user was not authenticated. This requires writing a dedicated
  Middleware.

Bootstrap 4 port
----------------
* replace panel by card
